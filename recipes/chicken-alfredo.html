        <p>Chicken, Cheese, Noodles. If you ain't about it, you can leave!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 oz dry fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, cut into large cubes or slices</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 3/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once itâ€™s shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes (or an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.)</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until butter has melted.</li>
            <li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.</li>
            <li>Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.</li>
            <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. (If the sauce ends up too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.)</li>
            <li>Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</li>
            <li>Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
        </ol>
