        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>The best plate of noodles you can get when you go out with the dangerous nights crew.</p>
        <p>Best served to those who <strong>USED</strong> to be a piece of shit.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound spaghet</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs cut in to 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li> 2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>fresh parsley, minced, for garnish</li>    
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water and 1 tablespoon salt to boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente, about 9 to 10 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat olive oil until shimmering. Add onion and bell pepper and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken and chili powder and season to taste with salt and pepper (I like 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper). Cook until chicken is golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chicken and vegetable mixture to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Return the Dutch oven to medium-high heat and melt butter. Whisk in flour and cook until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Whisk in milk and chicken broth and cook until thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper (I like 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper). Do not skip this step or your casserole may be bland!</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 cup cheddar cheese. Add cooked spaghetti and chicken and vegetable mixture and toss until well combined. Transfer to a 3-quart or larger baking dish and top with remaining 1 cup of cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake until hot and bubbly, about 20 to 25 minutes (a chicken piece should register 165 degrees on an internal thermometer). Let stand 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>
